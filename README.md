# Overview
Here you will find symbol and footprint all a large set of Microchip product, mainly microcontroller.
This is done with a generator, and an input database that I have build.


# content
I will try to provide symbols, on main CAD tool format
if you would like that i support other format please contact me and give me te full description of the format and (if possible) a licence of the software used.

# feature

## symbols
I try to define all symbol, with input, output, and supply and other pins.
the symbol description offer a good quality.

## footprint
today foot print isn't supported because I haven't build that database forr that.


# supported format

below you will see format supported :

## Kicad
[see for supported list](part-list.md)
## Altium
[see for supported list](part-list.md)
## Proteus
[see for supported list](part-list.md)
# road map
Q4-2024 a first beta realease with a large list of symbol working with Kicad.(without footprint)
xx-xxxx try to support last MCU introduced by microchip within the quarter that follow the support of MPlab.

Q1-2025 The goal is to complete the symbol to be able to use then on the 3 1st format.
Q2-2025 Extend the number of chip supported, staying on microchip catalog. Q1-2025
If manfacturer would like that I support their product, they can contact me for bussiness.


## fooprint
Q1-2025 start to support some footprint
Q3-2025 provide footprint for 75%
## 3d model
Qx-2026 at short term this isn't an objectif.

# supported chips
please refers to the file part-list.rm
